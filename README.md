# ðŸš€ Crypto Price Prediction

**A work-in-progress project aiming to predict Bitcoin price movements using past market data.**

**Objective**: Build a classification model to anticipate whether the BTC price will **go up**  or **go down**.

---

## ðŸ§  Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Random Forest + PCA  

---

## ðŸ”§ Current Focus

- Feature engineering (technical indicators, time-based signals, etc.)  
- Exploring model performance & interpretability  
- Backtesting strategies based on predictions  

---

## ðŸš§ What's next?

- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Add more advanced models (XGBoost, LSTM...)  
- Build a simple backtesting engine
